# Priority App
They will tell you that life is not a game, but what is life without some real, profitable fun? This is a game made to prioritize business critical tasks of the week so that you can be free to enjoy the rest of your actual life.

# History
Do you wish you had a better work-life balance? Most management professionals experience chronic, potentially debilitating stress from the workload of juggling people, projects, and problems on a nearly-constant 24 hour basis.

This nightmare is a true reality for many supers around the world.

I came up with the idea for this app to reduce the weekly stress of business management. It still has much to be developed into desired effect... However, the vision is here to stay. I have devoted myself to this project for my passion in helping small business owners learn how to manage their time effectively.

# Pending Functionality:
  * Deadlines - Mark a date on the tasks you need to complete.
